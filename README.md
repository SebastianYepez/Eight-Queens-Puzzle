# Eight-Queens-Puzzle
The Eight Queens Puzzle is a chess board dilemma in which the objective is to place eight queens on an 8 x 8 chessboard in such a manner that no two queens threaten each other. In this implementation, I've added a twist: the programmer can adjust the board size during compilation, offering flexibility in solving the puzzle.
